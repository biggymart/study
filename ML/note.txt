=================
What is ML?
Arthur Samel (1959): computers learning w/o explicit programming e.g> checkers player
Tom Michell (?): E experience, T task, P performance measure

ML algorithms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Recommender systems

### This course provides practical tips for using this tool to solve real problems ###
